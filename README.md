# Values to measure
The concept of a soundproof pod comes with various potential areas of measurement, both internally and externally. These values could be temperature, humidity, multi-faceted air quality, motion, sound, light and fire detection from within, alongside external temperature and sound. All such measurements pave the way to fully understand and improve the pod's performance and efficiency, ensuring optimal user comfort and safety.

## Internal Measurements:
- Temperature
   - Ensures comfort levels for enhanced productivity.
   - Provides early warnings for equipment malfunctions or overheating.
   - Optimizes energy usage through smarter HVAC control.

- Humidity
   - Helps maintain an environment minimising respiratory discomfort or diseases.
   - Protects sensitive equipment from humidity damage.
   - Alerts to potential water leaks within the pod.

- Air Quality (High Priority)
   - Improves overall health by reducing exposure to airborne pollutants.
   - Identifies presence of harmful gases or chemical leaks.
   - Particle sensors detect allergens providing a more accommodative environment for user health.

- Motion Sensing
   - Tracks usage patterns, optimizing energy management.
   - Integrates with emergency systems for improved safety.

- Sound Levels
   - Ensures the podcast remains a sound-free zone for focused tasks.
   - Detects anomalies, serving as an alert system for potential equipment issues. 

- Light Intensity
   - Delivers a mood-appropriate environment for varying activities.
   - Reduces eye strain and associated health issues.
   - Optimizes light-based energy consumption.

- Fire Detection
   - Satisfies safety compliance and insurance requirements.
   - Minimizes potential spread and damage by enabling prompt mitigation.

## External Measurements:
- Ambient Sound
   - Assesses the pod's soundproofing effectiveness.
   - Alerts to external disruptions or hazards.
   - Provides insights to improve design and materials for better noise isolation.

- Ambient Temperature
   - Regulates internal control systems for a consistent indoor climate.
   - Helps swiftly detect and adapt to outdoor climate changes.
   - Contributes in energy optimization while minimizing wastage.
